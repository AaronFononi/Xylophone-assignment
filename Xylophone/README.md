# Xylophone

## Goal of the Assignment

This project marks a fun dive into learning how to play sound in iOS apps by using **AVFoundation**, one of Apple's essential media libraries. The key focus of this assignment was to develop problem-solving skills by independently navigating **StackOverflow** and **Apple Documentation**. It's all about becoming self-sufficient and confident as an iOS developer, able to find solutions and add custom features to apps.

## What I Built

For this section of the course, I built my very first musical instrument app – a **Xylophone**! It’s a colorful and simple musical app, and while it’s not about the jokes (sorry, couldn’t help but keep the bad ones), it’s about getting hands-on experience with playing sounds and understanding how to implement such features in iOS.

## What I Learned

- **Playing Sounds with AVFoundation**: I now know how to use the **AVAudioPlayer** class to play audio files in an iOS app.
- **Navigating Apple Documentation**: I practiced finding information in Apple's developer documentation, a crucial skill to solve issues efficiently.
- **Understanding the Swift Language**: This project helped me sharpen my knowledge of Swift concepts like functions, methods, and loops.
- **Variable Scope and Swift Data Types**: I worked with different data types and learned how to manage variable scope to avoid common bugs.
- **Refining the ViewController Lifecycle**: I dove deeper into the **ViewController** lifecycle, learning when and how to initialize components like the audio player.
- **Debugging and Error Handling**: I gained more comfort debugging and refactoring code, using error handling practices when things didn’t go as expected.

## Key Code

Here’s the core code that made the Xylophone app come to life:

```swift
import UIKit
import AVFoundation

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    var player: AVAudioPlayer!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }

    @IBAction func keyPressed(_ sender: UIButton) {
        playSound()
    }
    
    func playSound() {
        let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "C", withExtension: "wav")
        player = try! AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: url!)
        player.play()
    }
}
```

## Course Information

This app is part of **Angela Yu’s Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp**, which you can check out [here](https://www.appbrewery.co). It’s been an incredible journey building these small but impactful apps while learning the core concepts of iOS development.
